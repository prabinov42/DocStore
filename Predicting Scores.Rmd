# Intro

In this document we explore the potential of predicting documents cores from text summarizations of the documents.

In this example, only two documents were summarized and had their goals scored, as the scores and summarizations were human generated. Furthermore, only one of the documents had its goals was scored. Hence, the approach described below is an illustration of what may be a feasible approach once more documents are summarized and scored.

One could also easily imagine using a system like ChatGPT to summarize the documents, saving human labour as well as ensuring a consistent approach to summarization.

# Data

Data here was manually copied from two spreadsheets, one per project. The spreadsheets were fairly consistent in their formatting, but to ease future work the following format is recommended:

- type, selected from: 'immediate', 'intermediate', 'long term', 'ultimate'
- outcome: a short text describing the desired outcome
- achievement, selected from: 'achieved', 'partly achieved', 'too early to evaluate'
- evidence: text string describing evidence
- score: 0-5, 5 is better

Note there are two sets of features we can use in this data: 
- the outcome: a short text string describing the results of the goal
- the evidence: a longer text string describing the evidence of the outcome

Suffixes _e_ and _o_ are used throughout to differentiate the data frames and results.

Below we try both approaches, as at this point with so little data it is not possible to determine a preferred approach.]

For each approach, we convert all words to lower case, and remove all punctuation and numbers. We remove stop-words, and then we stem each word. As the stem can be difficult to interpret, we determine the most commonly used word in the corpus with the same stem, and use that _most common representative_, or _mcr_, throughout.

```{r}
get_df_w_stems<-function(df, colName){
df_w_stems <- df %>%
  mutate(iword = {{colName}}) %>%
  mutate(
    iword = str_to_lower(iword),
    iword = str_replace_all(iword, "\\d", " "),
    iword = str_replace_all(iword, "[:punct:]", " ")
  ) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, iword) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word" = "word")) %>%
  mutate( stem = wordStem( word, language="en")) 

df_stems <- df_w_stems %>%
  count(stem, word) %>%
  arrange(stem, desc(n)) %>%
  group_by(stem) %>%
  summarize( word=first(word))

df_w_stems <- df_w_stems %>% left_join(df_stems, join_by(stem==stem)) %>%
  rename(original_word=word.x, mcr=word.y)

return(df_w_stems)
}


dfs_o <- get_df_w_stems(df, outcome)
dfs_e <- get_df_w_stems(df, evidence)
```

# Models

We use the [lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) in order to predict the goal score from the words used in the text.

```{r}

get_lasso_coefs <- function(df) {
  x <- model.matrix(score ~ mcr, df)
  y <- df$score
  train <- sample(1:nrow(x), nrow(x) * 0.8)
  test <- (-train)
  y.test <- y[test]
  grid <- 10^seq(10, -2, length = 100)
  lasso.mod <- glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 1, lambda = grid)
  cv.out <- cv.glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 1)
  bestlam <- cv.out$lambda.1se
  lasso.pred <- predict(lasso.mod, s = bestlam, newx = x[test, ])
  out <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 1, lambda = grid)
  lasso.coef <- predict(out, type = "coefficients", s = bestlam)
  coefsdf <- as.data.frame(summary(lasso.coef))
  coefsdf$var_name <- NA
  cn <- dimnames(lasso.coef)[[1]]
  for (i in 1:nrow(coefsdf)) {
    r <- coefsdf[i, ]
    coefsdf$var_name[i] <- cn[r[1, 1]]
  }
  coefsdf <- coefsdf %>%
    mutate(var_name = if_else(var_name == "(Intercept)", "Intercept", str_sub(var_name, 4))) %>%
    select(var_name, estimate = x)
  return(coefsdf)
}

```


## Outcomes
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dfs_o_m <- dfs_o %>% filter(!is.na(score))
get_lasso_coefs(dfs_o_m) %>% kable()
```

The results show the coefficients of the best lasso model, similar to a regression.
We see that the intercept is about 3.77 (typical score) and the coefficient for the words _maximized_ contribute to the goal's score by the estimate shown. In other words, a goal that mentioned the word _maximized_ in the outcome can be expected to have a score of about 3.7702717-0.0271354=3.743136 if none of the other words shown in the table are mentioned in the outcome. And no other words affect the score.

Note however that only one word affects the score - this is almost certainly a function of the small amount of data used to build the model.

## Evidence

```{r}
dfs_e_m <- dfs_e %>% filter(!is.na(score))
get_lasso_coefs(dfs_e_m) %>% kable()
```

We see similar results as with outcome, but here only two words affect the score. If the evidence contains _prevention_ the score can be expected to decrease by 0.0474512, and if the evidence contains _shelter_ the score can be expected to decrease by 0.0087223.

Again, the small number of words listed is likely an artificial of the small sample size.

# Conclusion

The lasso approach is well known and frequent works very well. Once more documents are summarized and scored, this code should be adapted and run to see how well the models predict the scores in order to assess it's usefulness.

Also to be noted is that the supplied summaries are somewhat inconsistent in their format and style - again suggesting that an automated system for creating the summaries, like ChatGPT may prove very useful.
